/*
The Dstore class.
This class will handle : todo add here


Processes should send textual messages (e.g., LIST) using the println() method of
PrintWriter class, and receive using the readLine() method of BufferedReader class. For
data messages (i.e., file content), processes should send using the write() method of
OutputStream class and receive using the readNBytes() method of InputStream class.

    Constructor
    java Dstore port cport timeout file_folder

The Dstore is started with the port to listen on (port) and the controller’s port to talk to
(cport), timeout in milliseconds (timeout) and where to store the data locally
(file_folder). Each Dstore should use a different path and port so they don’t clash.
The client is started with the controller port to communicate with it (cport) and a timeout
in milliseconds (timeout).
